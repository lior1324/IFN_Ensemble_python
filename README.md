# IFN_Ensemble
In this project we have created a new data mining classification model: IFN based Ensemeble.
IFN Forest Ensemble is an Ensemble model based on Random Forest, but instead of CART trees we used IFN models.
In order to use this code you can see our examples in the Main file at src.
We gave examples in order to run:
1. single IFN model in java
2. IFN with train csv and test csv
3. run IFN forest
4. IFN forest with train csv and test csv

In order to change the hyper parameter of ifn or ifn forest you can check our functions in Main at src.

The nominal input attributes at the datasets must have an addition "_nominal".
For example: Gender -> Geneder_nominal.
