# IFN_Ensemble
In this project we have implemented a new data mining classification model: IFN based Ensemeble (IFN Forest).  
IFN Forest is an ensemble algorithm based on Random Forest, but instead of CART trees we used IFN models.  
In order to use this code you can see our examples in the Main file at src.  
The names of nominal input attributes at the datasets must have an addition "_nominal".  
For example: Gender -> Gender_nominal.
